This folder contains a set of some simple lox scripts to test my interpreter, from variable declaration, block scope, functions, to classes, and more. It's far from comprehensive, though a lot of these cases come from the book itself. There are lots and lots of [tests](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/4a840f70f69c6ddd17cfef4f6964f8e1bcd8c3d4/test) for lox edge cases. I could copy all of them over, but I've also worked on some tweaks to the language as an exercise for myself, so some of those tests may not apply, or the tests would be incomplete.
